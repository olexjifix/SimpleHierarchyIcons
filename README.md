Just download it from github and import the whole folder "Custom Hierarchy Icons" OR go to releases and download the Unity package file for import.

For your scripts, import an Icon with the following settings:
<img width="542" height="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0bf8cb0-2733-42da-a8c1-887d9eec3c81" />

Now select your script and change the icon:

<img width="541" height="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b910e4df-8e37-4272-a6ec-77c4d6041816" />

Now under Tools -> Hierarchy Icons -> Settings

<img width="364" height="231" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44495d2b-ec82-438a-aa2f-510afd63fb33" />

Then drag and drop your own script (click add) or show built-in icons and add them so they are show in the hierarchy:

<img width="729" height="741" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e5a6cdb-5025-4275-be17-b85159ffb155" />

Hierarchy shows now the icon:

<img width="447" height="31" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4badf1c-bd91-45b7-a584-a2fd536a3625" />

Feel free to extend it!
